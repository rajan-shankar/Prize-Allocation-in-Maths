# Scholarships-and-Prizes-in-Maths

A report providing suggestions on how to allocate scholarships and prizes to students undertaking first-year math units. This was a group 
project that I lead in my DATA1901 unit. The data used for the analysis was a collection of anonymised marks and demographical 
characteristics of students who took first-year math units in 2018. It was obtained from the Institutional Analytics and Planning 
department at the University of Sydney.
